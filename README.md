# IUS_C202_PA5
Programming Assignment 5 for Dr. H's 202 class

### Abstract

The problem here is the same as the one from [Programming Assignment 4](../IUS_C202_PA4/blob/master/README.md).

The implementation varies slightly however, a binary search tree is used to query the random dictionary file to search for words as opposed to a linear data structure in PA4
